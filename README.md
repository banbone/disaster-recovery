# Disaster recovery!
As we all know, hardware is finite, but github is forever. I've set up this backup script to automatically backup my configuration to github in the (inreasingly likely) event that my hardware is incapacitated.
This should make it easier to get most of my configuration back mostly painlessly - no credentials though so that's another problem for another day...
